* Visit the links and download the videos.
* I downloaded the videos by observing the Network inspector after pressing play and seeing the MP4 file downloaded and saving it manually.
* Convert the MP4 video files to MTS to make sure timestamps don't get screwed up when concatenating them later.
* Add text to each video.
* Concat them all together.
